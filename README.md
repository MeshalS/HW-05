in this application it will  allows the user to save events for each hour of the day so that they can save their taks .We used the js momenet to have the current time. 


In this Ex. it will show how we know if it is PM Or AM
   <!-- let time = '';
    if (hour > 11) {
        time = hour + 'PM'
    } else {
        time = hour + 'AM'
    } -->

in this Ex. it will show How we know if it future or past or presnet 
 <!-- if (hour == currentHours){
            return "present";
        }else if (hour > currentHours){
            /// time is ahead of us 
            return "future"; 
        }else if (hour < currentHours) {
            // means the time is behind... so past 
            return "past"; 
        }else {
            return ""; 
        } -->

This HW covers the JQuey and Js and local-storage. ALos , it allow me to know new things as i was finding way to create HTML elmenet rather then using Jquey to create the Row and col. I used `` this has made it easy so as to get the what i am passing and being able to have more easy. 


in this Ex. it will show about the creation of object that store the hour 

  <!-- if (listOfTasksObj == undefined){
       // means the obj has not been created 
       // only happens once. In first creation. 
       listOfTasksObj = {}; 
       //passing the hour to once you do the save 
       listOfTasksObj[saveHourKey] = inputValue;  -->
